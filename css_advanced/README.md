SmileSchool Landing Page

A modern, responsive landing page built with HTML5 and CSS3, inspired by the SmileSchool design concept.
This project demonstrates practical front-end implementation skills, including layout design, responsive styling, and component consistency across different sections of a web page.

# Overview

The SmileSchool Landing Page is designed to showcase a cohesive and visually appealing interface for an educational platform.
It features a clear call-to-action, structured content hierarchy, and a smooth flow from the hero section to the footer — all developed using only HTML and CSS without frameworks.

# Key Features

  Prominent background image with bold “Get schooled” heading and a call-to-action button.

- Navigation Header:
  Aligned logo and menu items styled for balance and clarity.

- Learn from the Pros Section:
  Responsive card layout highlighting instructor profiles.

- FAQ Section:
  Two-column grid design for clean readability.

- Footer:

# Technologies Used

HTML5 – for semantic structure

  Sections are logically grouped for easier styling and content flow.

  Used class-based selectors for modularity and minimal repetition.
  Applied gradients, hover effects, and typography scaling to enhance visual appeal.

  Buttons, text, and images scale appropriately for mobile and desktop displays.
